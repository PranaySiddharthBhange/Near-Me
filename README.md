# Near Me

An app that can help people find the nearest available resources in their area.

A Brief of the Prototype:

The prototype starts with a map view as the first screen, with a bottom navigation bar to navigate further in the app. There are multiple service pages where users can view listed services and add new ones. When adding a service, users can input the service name, description, contact number, address, and location. The location is automatically fetched from the user's current location, but users can also add a service by clicking on the map. Additionally, users can search for services by name and view details of service providers.
